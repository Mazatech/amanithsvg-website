# The coordinates system 

The initial SVG viewport coordinate system (and therefore the initial user coordinate system) has its origin at the top/left of the viewport, with the positive x-axis pointing towards the right, the positive y-axis pointing down.

This pixel-based coordinate system is known as the surface coordinate system: pixel `(0, 0)` is located at the upper-left corner of the drawing surface.
